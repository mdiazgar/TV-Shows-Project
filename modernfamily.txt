ACT ONE
1 EXT. SUBURBAN AMERICAN STREET -- DAY
The camera pushes in to a SUBURBAN HOUSE.
CLAIRE (O.S.)
Kids! Breakfast!
2 INT. KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS
Claire is busy making breakfast for the family. Phil enters
in workout clothes.
CLAIRE
What's with the workout clothes?
(then)
Kids!!!
PHIL
What? I work out.
(glances toward the
camera)
Just because I don't run six miles a
day like you --
CLAIRE
Eight.
PHIL
You run eight miles a day? That's
like three-thousand miles a year.
You could have run to Hawaii.
CLAIRE
I think about that every single day.
(shouting out)
BREAKFAST!!!
Haley enters in a short skirt.
HALEY
I'm having a friend over today.
CLAIRE
Haley, you're not wearing that skirt.
HALEY
What's wrong with it?
CLAIRE
It's too short. People can tell
you're a girl, you don't have to
prove it to them.
Alex enters.

ALEX
(matter of fact)
Luke got his head stuck in the
banister again.
PHIL
I got it. Where's the baby oil?
CLAIRE
It's in our night stan--
(eyes camera)
I don't know -- find it!
3 INTERVIEW -- PHIL & CLAIRE
SUPER: "Phil & Claire"
CLAIRE
Raising kids is like building a car.
You only have so much time to make
sure the steering works and the brakes
stop and the engine is dependable
before you send it out on the road,
and if you get one little rivet wrong,
it will drive off a cliff and explode.
Awkward beat.
PHIL
We have a lot of fun.
4 EXT SOCCER FIELD -- DAY
Gloria and Jay watch as Gloria's son Manny plays in a soccer
game. Gloria paces around nervously. Jay, dressed in a
track suit, sits in a low folding chair, reading the paper.
GLORIA
Go, Manny, go! Kick it! Don't let
him -- kick it!
The opposing player trips Manny.
GLORIA (CONT'D)
He tripped him! Where's the penalty?!
JAY
Gloria, they're oh and six. Let's
take it down a notch.
An opposing player gets the ball. It's only Manny between
him and the goal.
MY AMERICAN FAMILY "Pilot" 12-9-08 3.

GLORIA
(while HITTING Jay)
Get the ball, Manny! Stop him. You
can do it!
But Manny gets distracted by a PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL riding by
on a bicycle. The opposing player dribbles around Manny and
SCORES. An uptight SOCCER MOM approaches the coach, oblivious
that Gloria is Manny's mom.
SOCCER MOM
Come on, Coach, you gotta take that
kid out.
Gloria wheels on her.
GLORIA
You want to take him out?! How about
I take you out?!
Jay grabs the back of her jacket.
JAY
Honey, honey...
GLORIA
(to Soccer Mom)
Why don't you worry about your son?
He spend the first half with his
hand in his pants.
Gloria moves off, disgusted. Jay, having been through scenes
like this before, shakes his head as A SOCCER DAD approaches.
SOCCER DAD
Whoa, remind me not to mess with
your daughter.
JAY
My daughter?
(annoyed, struggles
to get up)
No, that's funny, actually, no, she's
my wife. Don't be fooled by the --
just give me a second here.
5 INTERVIEW -- JAY AND GLORIA
SUPER: "Jay and Gloria"
JAY
Gloria and I met the day my ex-wife
moved to Florida. I was feeling pretty
emotional and Gloria was one of the
bikini bartenders at the giant pool
party I threw.
MY AMERICAN FAMILY "Pilot" 12-9-08 4.

GLORIA
We're very different. Jay is from
the city, he has a big business, I
come from a small village, very poor
but very, very beautiful. It is the
number one village in all of Colombia
for the... what's the word?
JAY
Murders.
GLORIA
Yes, the murders.
6 INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

PASSENGER #2
Hi, precious.
MITCHELL
(waving Lily's hand
for her)
Hi.

We just adopted her. From Vietnam.
We're bringing her home for the first
time.
People across the aisle join in.
PASSENGER #3
She's such a little angel.
(to Lily)
I can just tell you're going to be a
daddy's girl, aren't you?
Cameron enters and plops next to Mitchell.
CAMERON
Sorry, sorry, this boy needed a
Cinnabon.
MITCHELL
(to Passenger #3)
Let's hope so.
