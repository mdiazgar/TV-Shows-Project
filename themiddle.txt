FADE IN: 1 EXT. MIDWESTERN ROAD - ORSON,INDIANA -- LATE AFTERNOON 1 A DESERTED two-lane ROAD -- flat, cornfields... space as far as the eye can see. Suddenly, in the foreground A CELL PHONE POPS UP and into frame. And then HALF OF A WOMAN'S FACE PEEKS UP straining to talk into the phone. FRANKIE C'mon, c'mon. Hello? Hello? (then) Dammit. WE POP WAY UP AND WIDE to reveal the LONE FIGURE, FRANKIE HECK, mom, 40's, standing in the middle of the road in an ILL-FITTING SUPERWOMAN COSTUME... leotard, tights... cape. She's trying to get a cell phone signal. FRANKIE (V.O.) Some people call this the middle of nowhere. You know, one of those places you fly over on your way from somewhere to somewhere else, but you wouldn't live here? QUICK CUT TO: 2 INT. AIRPLANE -- DAY 2 Passengers are reading, working on laptops, etc. PILOT ON P.A. (O.S.) Folks, right now we're flying over the great state of Indiana, if you'd like to take a look. Not a single person so much as GLANCES out the window. FRANKIE (V.O.) Well, look down next time, and you'll see us, down here in the middle. 3 A colorful retro MAP of the United States. A PIN DROPS DOWN 3 TO MARK where we are. We ZOOM DOWN AND IN to Midwestern Americana in all its glory... malls, lawnmower parades, ceramic lawn geese in sweaters... FRANKIE (V.O.) Orson, Indiana. Proud home of Little Betty Snackcakes, the World's Biggest Garage Sale... Nobody famous ever came from here or anything, but they say Gus Grissom the astronaut stopped in for a pop once on his way to the moon. THE MIDDLE "Pilot" Table Draft (white) 1/28/09 2. 4 A BRONZE PLAQUE on the side of a local grocery reads, "Gus 4 Grissom the astronaut stopped here for a pop once on his way to the moon." 5 EXT. MIDWESTERN ROAD -- DUSK 5 FRANKIE (V.O.) So how'd I end up by the side of the road in this get up? QUICK CUTS: Frankie, still trying to get a phone signal, SERPENTINES her way across the road; the CELL PHONE skims along the top of the corn as she moves through the field; Frankie up a phone pole. FRANKIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Keep your pants on, I'm getting there. Guess it all started a couple weeks ago -- and no, I'm not an actual superhero... 6 EXT. HECK HOUSE -- MORNING 6 One story... middle class. Bicycles and other kid debris on the lawn. FRANKIE (V.O.) ... not unless you count getting my kids out the door for school every morning. 7 INT. HECK KITCHEN -- SAME 7 THWACK. A freezer door opens. A HAND pulls out a box of frozen waffles, tosses a STUCK TOGETHER WAD of them into the microwave, presses the button. FRANKIE (calling) I made breakfast! Come on! We're late. Let's go! Morning chaos. Frankie, dressed for work, is doing a million things at once, slapping food into lunch boxes, haphazardly pulling breakfast together, searching through piles of mail for something. A slightly odd 7-YEAR-OLD BOY wanders through the kitchen, reading a book. FRANKIE (V.O.) That's Brick. I read somewhere kids go farther in life if they have interesting names. Turns out Brick's a cool name if you're Paul Newman in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. But if you're my Brick, well... THE MIDDLE "Pilot" Table Draft (white) 1/28/09 3. Brick pulls a soggy clump of yuck out of his inexplicably leaky backpack. Frankie hands him a waffle in a paper towel. FRANKIE Now today at recess, no wandering alone on the perimeter. Makes you an easy target -- like the gazelle that gets separated from the pack. You gotta find yourself a group of kids and just -- stand near 'em. BRICK You know you're my hero, right Mom? FRANKIE That's sweet, honey. Eat your waffle. BRICK (taking a bite) It's still frozen. FRANKIE Then lick it, it'll last longer. (calling) Mike! Have you seen that envelope with my new drivers' license in it?! I need it for work. Why is this place such a mess? AXL, 15, typical jock-y teenager -- cute, but kinda gross right now from sleep, comes lumbering into the kitchen wearing only his underwear, rubbing his eyes. FRANKIE (V.O.) That's Axl -- Guns N' Roses played a key part in his conception. Since he hit fifteen he's like a bear that hibernates in his room and only comes out to paw through our food and shoot off sarcastic comments. AXL (foraging in cabinets) We're out of chips. Nice job, Mom. FRANKIE Can't hear you unless you have pants on. Did you see my envelope from the DMV -- BRICK Mom! Where's my home -- Without looking up, Frankie hands Brick his homework, and in doing so, finds the envelope she's been looking for. THE MIDDLE "Pilot" Table Draft (white) 1/28/09 4. FRANKIE A-ha. She rips it open and pulls out her new driver's license -- looks at it, stunned. FRANKIE (CONT'D) Oh my God. (checking herself out in a nearby mirror) When did this happen? Her husband, MIKE, 39, upstanding, Midwestern, honest to the point of annoyance sometimes, enters and starts pitching in to get the family out the door. FRANKIE (CONT'D) Mike. Look at this. (shows picture) It's been seven years since I got my last driver's license picture taken. Look at this one, compared to my old one. What happened to me? CLOSE ON The two licenses side by side... one hopeful and smiling... the other, well... haggard. MIKE (laughing) Well, back then you were all young and shiny, wondering what your life was gonna be and now, well ...now you know. Frankie takes this in. SUE (O.S.) Mo-om! FRANKIE Come in here if you want to talk to me! Axl, put on some pants. Brick hands Frankie a wet permission slip. She signs it with a BLACK SHARPIE, then quickly begins coloring her grey hairs with it. FRANKIE (CONT'D) Mike, does it ever bum you out that I'm not all young and shiny anymore? That my, you know, contents kinda shifted during flight? MIKE Sure, honey, it's a huge bummer. But what are you gonna do? (MORE) THE MIDDLE "Pilot" Table Draft (white) 1/28/09 5. MIKE (CONT'D) (looking in the cabinet) Shoot, I wanted chips for my lunch. AXL (without looking up) She didn't buy any. SUE, 14, unremarkable in her averageness, comes in carrying a pair of destroyed leg warmers. FRANKIE Sue, why aren't you ready? FRANKIE (V.O.) You heard right. Sue. Our success names? Only got two out of three. But it was a promise Mike had made to his Grammy Heck on her deathbed. 8 FLASHBACK -- THE DEATHBED 8 Mike's unbelievably gnarled GRAMMY reaches out and GRABS them with her bony fingers. GRAMMY HECK (barely a whisper) Sue. And she dies. 9 RESUME SCENE 9 SUE Mom, the dryer ate my leg warmers. I need 'em 'cause... guess what? I'm trying out for Show Choir this week! Frankie and Mike share a look of dread. FRANKIE (V.O.) I know, that's not an expression parents should have on their faces when their daughter tells them she's trying out for something. But see, Sue had a long history of things she tried out for... FLASHBACKS -- QUICK CUTS 10 - Sue trying out for FLAGS. She stands in a formation with 10 three other girls, whirling the giant, unwieldy flag around. Unable to hold it up, she falls sideways with it out of frame. 11 - Sue trying out for SPANISH CLUB. She speaks in Spanish 11 and in subtitles we learn what she says is, "I should be accepted into Spanish Club because I am breasts." THE MIDDLE "Pilot" Table Draft (white) 1/28/09 6. 12 - Sue trying out for GYMNASTICS. She jumps over a pommel 12 horse and lands flat on her back, unconscious. 13 RESUME SCENE 13 Frankie and Mike instantly plaster smiles on their faces. MIKE Show choir? Super. That ought to be fun to try out for. FRANKIE Look, your dad's gonna fix the dryer, but right now let's just please get out the door. Here. You can brush your teeth in the car. MIKE I don't know if it can be fixed. (with a grin) Just like you, Frankie. The old girl's just worn out. Frankie laughs grudgingly, then takes another look at the driver's license, scrutinizes it. FRANKIE (V.O.) He thought he was just being cute, but the driver's license thing had hit me like a ton of bricks. I looked like I'd been hit by a ton of bricks. But who... or what... had done this to me? FRANKIE'S POV of the license with the haggard picture in her hand. She moves it down and BELOW FRAME to REVEAL the family, now bickering and taunting each other as they get ready to go out the door. SUE/AXL/BRICK Mom! Axl ripped my homework! /Mom! The waffles are frozen. /Mom!/ Moom! /Moooooooom! Frankie EYES THEM all with suspicion as the cacophony of "Moom's" continues from outside the door. FRANKIE (to Mike) We did teach them the word "Dad" also, didn't we? They continue out the door, and as the door SHUTS behind them, it serves as our... SMASH CUT TO: MAIN TITLE END OF ACT ONE THE MIDDLE "Pilot" Table Draft (white) 1/28/09 7. ACT TWO 14 EXT. ORSON -- MORNING 14 FRANKIE (V.O.) We're a two job family. Two jobs and no career. Mike manages a bunch of idiots down at the quarry... 15 INT. LIMESTONE QUARRY -- MORNING 15 Mike sits behind a desk pushing papers. A sign behind him reads "NUMBER OF DAYS WITHOUT A WORK-RELATED INJURY: 0" 16 EXT. EHLERT MOTORS -- MORNING 16 The sign outside reads, "Free Sno-Cone With Every Test Drive." FRANKIE (V.O.) ...And my latest job I'm too smart for is selling cars at Orson's foremost new and used car dealer. 17 INT. EHLERT MOTORS -- CONTINUOUS 17 The place hasn't changed decor since the sixties. Frankie and her friend and fellow salesman, BOB, are opening their monthly paychecks. PETE, THE KING OF SALES, crosses through gloating over his. PETE Wow. Wow, wow, wow. What a month, huh? BOB Don't let him intimidate you, Frankie. He may be the King of Sales here, but he's been rejected by the Kiwanis twice. I'm not gonna say by who... (then) It was me. Told 'em he's a pedophile. And he's not! FRANKIE (opening check) Whoa, Bob. This can't be right. My check this week is lower than the amount I spent on gas to get here. 18 INT. MR. EHLERT'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS 18 Guns, animal heads, Hoosier basketball posters stare at Frankie from all sides. MR EHLERT, 60s, a good ol' boy, looks at her check, slides it across the desk back to her. THE MIDDLE "Pilot" Table Draft (white) 1/28/09 8. MR. EHLERT Ain't nothing wrong with the check, Frances. That there's your base salary. And that's what it's gonna stay until you sell a car and get a commission. One week left in the month. You sell a car, or we may have to... reevaluate. FRANKIE Okay, technically I may not have sold an actual car yet, but I have come real close. MR. EHLERT (re: head on wall) See that buck up there? He came real close to not being hit by a bullet. You see what I'm saying? He fixes her with an intimidating stare. FRANKIE Well, I guess what I'm asking for here is my own personal bailout -- MR. EHLERT I don't get it. All the articles I've read say women want to buy cars from other women. That's why I went against all judgment and hired one. Now you have the opportunity here to carry a torch for all ladykind, or burn the whole deal down. It's up to you. Frankie can't believe this guy, but knows she has to be civil. FRANKIE Wow. I'm kinda like the Rosa Parks of Ehlert Cars, huh? MR. EHLERT Rosa Parks. Don't even get me started on her. (then) And by the way, you ever get your new driver's license? We've got to post them and that old one didn't look a thing like you. Frankie reluctantly shows him the new one. MR. EHLERT (CONT'D) Oh yeah. Now that's you. THE MIDDLE "Pilot" Table Draft (white) 1/28/09 9. 19 EXT. EHLERT MOTORS -- A LITTLE LATER 19 Frankie, feeling the pressure, is reeling in a potential carbuyer, MR. YAMAMOTO. FRANKIE You know, I don't consider myself a saleswoman. I see myself as more of a matchmaker really for people and vehicles, and I just have a feeling about you and this hatchback. Why don't we go on a little test drive and give you two a chance to get to know each other. He nods, and Frankie, feeling good, crosses to the back to get the key, hears the aging P.A. system. P.A. (O.S.) Frankie, you have a call on line one. Your son's school is on line one. FRANKIE No, not now. (calling to P.A.) Hurt or in trouble?! 'Cause if it's just in trouble can you ask if I can call 'em back? The voice on the P.A. sighs an exasperated sigh. 20 INT. EHLERT MOTORS -- A MOMENT LATER 20 FRANKIE (picks up) This is Frankie. Is everything okay? 21 EXT. ORSON ELEMENTARY FRONT STEPS -- 3:35 PM 21 Brick sits all by himself, waiting for his ride that hasn't come. 22 BACK TO SCENE 22 FRANKIE Dammit. She dials. 23 INT. MIKE'S OFFICE -- LIMESTONE QUARRY 23 MIKE (into phone) Dammit. Well, you said you were picking him up. THE MIDDLE "Pilot" Table Draft (white) 1/28/09 10. FRANKIE No, Mike, you said you were. I even stuck a post-it on your thermos. 24 INT. SHOWROOM FLOOR -- SAME TIME 24 Through the window, Frankie notices Pete sidling up to Mr. Yamamoto. She bangs on the glass with the phone, shoots Pete a stern mom look that makes him step back. 25 INT. CAR -- A FEW MINUTES LATER 25 Frankie and Mr. Yamamoto are on the test drive. FRANKIE Sorry about the little delay. Take a left up here... (he turns left) Smooth, huh? Now I know times are tough, but we do have great leasing plans available... get in the right lane aaaand -- Pull over right here! (leaning out window) Get in! Get in! And Brick scrambles into the back seat with his backpack. Mr. Yamamoto is startled, but Frankie makes like this is nothing unusual. FRANKIE (CONT'D) Brick, honey? How do you like those seats? BRICK They're amazing. They also come with optional leather trim and Preferred Suede inserts. She and Brick look at Mr. Yamamoto, sellin' it. 26 EXT./INT. EHLERT MOTORS -- LATER 26 Frankie and Brick sit staring out the window, drinking out of Ehlert Motors mugs, as Mr. Yamamoto PEELS OUT in his own car, dumping his free sno-cone on the ground. BRICK At least you're still my hero. FRANKIE Thanks, pal. 27 INT. HECK KITCHEN -- THAT NIGHT 27 A BUNCH OF McDonalds is DUMPED on the table. THE MIDDLE "Pilot" Table Draft (white) 1/28/09 11. FRANKIE (calling) I made supper! The rest of the family ambles in. Axl, once again in only his underwear, tries to grab his food and take it to his room. MIKE Hey, Underpants! Where do you think you're going? FRANKIE We are a family, and we are eating together as a family! SMASH CUT TO: 28 INT. LIVING ROOM -- A FEW MINUTES LATER 28 The entire family is lined up on the couch, eating their McDonalds and watching Dancing With the Stars. Frankie grabs the remote and mutes. FRANKIE Commercial! Okay, quick we got three minutes to hear about everybody's day. Mine sucked. Next. SUE Well... I'm trying to decide what number I should do for my show choir audition. I'm between -- The whole family shoots each other the familiar LOOK OF DREAD. SUE (CONT'D) (noticing) What? AXL Does it really matter what song you pick? There's no way you're gonna make it. SUE Mom! FRANKIE (glaring at Axl) Your brother just means you should choose whatever song you like. MIKE Me, I like a quick song. Quick. Leave 'em wanting more. THE MIDDLE "Pilot" Table Draft (white) 1/28/09 12. BRICK You have a meeting with my teacher Monday. FRANKIE What? BRICK It's imperative that you both be there she says. (whispering to himself) Imperative. MIKE Who's he whispering to? Why does he do that? (to Brick) I told you to knock that off. BRICK I like it. It soothes me. FRANKIE What kind of teacher meeting? We never got any note. Brick spits out a chewed up wad of paper he hadn't been aware he was chewing, gives it to them. This kind of thing happens. AXL You are so weird. FRANKIE (reading it) Great. It's Monday. I gotta work Monday. MIKE Me too. Last time I took off a guy lost three toes. BRICK Sorry. (whispering to himself) Sorry. (to Mike, re: whispering) Sorry. DISSOLVE TO: 29 EXT. HECK BACKYARD -- LATER THAT NIGHT 29 Mike sits on a folding lawn chair, nursing a beer. Frankie comes out the sliding door. THE MIDDLE "Pilot" Table Draft (white) 1/28/09 13. FRANKIE I thought you were supposed to be fixing my dryer. MIKE I was about to and then I remembered... I don't wanna. FRANKIE Come on, if you get it working again (holding up bag) I might share some of these with ya from the secret stash I keep from Axl. MIKE Chips! FRANKIE (pulling them away. laughing) I said if you get it working! He pulls her onto the chair with him. Sue appears in her pajamas. SUE Mom, Dad. FRANKIE (hiding chips) Hmmm? SUE Are you guys disappointed in me? You know, that I never make anything? MIKE (utterly without sarcasm) Sure I'm disappointed, honey. This is the twelfth thing you're trying out for. I'm beginning to wonder if it's you, if it's me. Something I did...? SUE I'm thinking maybe I won't try out for show choir, if you guys don't think I should. Frankie and Mike eye each other. THE MIDDLE "Pilot" Table Draft (white) 1/28/09 14. 30 QUICK CUTS of STOCK FOOTAGE OF different Indiana show choirs 30 singing and dancing, FRANKIE (V.O.) Of course she shouldn't. I mean, show choir in Indiana is huge. Next to basketball, its combination of singing and dazzling Broadway-caliber choreography is the most cutthroat competition around. 31 CLOSE ON Sue's oh so average self, absently picking at her 31 braces. FRANKIE (V.O.) There was no way Sue was getting in. FRANKIE Go for it. SUE You really think so? (then) Dad? MIKE (pained smile) This could be your year. Frankie and Mike share a look. SMASH CUT TO: 32 INT. CHURCH -- SUNDAY MORNING 32 Frankie kneels in her own private prayer. FRANKIE Dear Lord, I know in your infinite wisdom, there was a reason Sue didn't make swim team, or band, or 4-H, or art club... which frankly seemed weird because everybody gets in to art club. But please, please let her make show choir. Thank you. (starts to get up, then) Oh, and please let the dryer hang on a little longer. (starts to get up, then) Oh, and -- No, you know what, you've got a lot on your plate what with the Middle East and Amy Winehouse and all ...so I'm just gonna stick with those two for now. Amen. FADE OUT. END OF ACT TWO THE MIDDLE "Pilot" Table Draft (white) 1/28/09 15. ACT THREE 33 INT. BRICK'S CLASSROOM -- THE NEXT DAY 33 Frankie and Mike sit at a little table with Brick's teacher, MRS. RETTIG, a bureaucrat in a scarecrow sweater. FRANKIE (V.O.) I didn't know how I was gonna get time off work for Brick's teacher meeting. Luckily, a customer came in wanting a test drive... 34 EXT. SCHOOL -- SAME TIME 34 THE CUSTOMER sits in a car outside the school waiting, checks his watch. 35 RESUME SCENE 35 MRS. RETTIG (delicately) Brick... is a very "quirky" child. Maybe... clinically quirky, even. Frankie and Mike just look at her. FRANKIE We have no idea what you mean. FRANKIE (V.O.) We knew exactly what she meant. QUICK CUTS 36 - A group of KIDS sing "Happy Birthday" to Brick, but Brick 36 faces the opposite way reading a book. 37 - Brick, trying to get Mrs. Rettig's attention, cluelessly 37 pats her boob. 38 - Brick walks to the bathroom pulling down his pants before 38 he gets there, as KIDS laugh. 39 RESUME SCENE 39 MRS. RETTIG He's very bright, but I feel Brick could benefit from a series of more formal tests... to see if we can help him... be more like everyone else. Our "S is for Special" Success Team is here as -- FRANKIE Yeah, okay. (MORE) THE MIDDLE "Pilot" Table Draft (white) 1/28/09 16. FRANKIE (CONT'D) You know, Brick may not be your typical kid, but he's funny and sweet and probably a genius who's gonna cure diseases or invent a new kinda space phone or something and just because he's not fitting into some cookie cutter mold does not mean something's the matter with him that needs fixing. Our oldest son had a completely pointed head until he was six -- MIKE (nodding) Like a candy corn. FRANKIE And sure everybody stared at us in the grocery, but you know what we did? We wrapped it in gauze, told people he had a head injury, and eventually, it flattened out all on its own. MIKE I think what we're trying to say is thanks for your concern, but our Brick doesn't need any special anything. He's fine. MRS. RETTIG His best friend is his backpack. They sigh. MIKE So how much we talking here for this testing? 40 INT. EHLERT MOTORS -- DAY 40 Frankie is urgently trying to sell a car to a somewhat frumpy woman in her 40s, GAIL. FRANKIE (V.O.) One week and no sales later I was looking for a miracle. GAIL Actually, I am interested in this car. FRANKIE (in disbelief) Get outta town. THE MIDDLE "Pilot" Table Draft (white) 1/28/09 17. GAIL But I was just wondering if a convertible is too wild for me? FRANKIE Are you kidding? Wild on the outside, but dependable on the inside. You know I consider myself a match -- P.A. (O.S.) Frankie. Call on line one. FRANKIE -- a matchmaker for people and vehicles -- P.A. (O.S.) It's your husband. FRANKIE -- And you know, you look -- P.A. (O.S.) He sounds mad. He's at Axl's school. He needs you to pick up Brick. FRANKIE (yelling to P.A.) Well, you tell him it's his turn! Tell him to read his damn thermos! -- GAIL Look, I can always come back another day. (with a smile) I'm a mom too. I know what it's like. Filled with gratitude, Frankie gives her a kiss on the top of her head, and takes off. 41 INT. HECK KITCHEN/FAMILY ROOM - LATER 41 Frankie enters, with Brick in tow. Mike is in the process of laying into Axl. MIKE -- and now you're suspended for three games! What the hell's the matter with you? You think you're looking at a scholarship like this? FRANKIE What'd he do? MIKE He called his football coach a moron. THE MIDDLE "Pilot" Table Draft (white) 1/28/09 18. AXL You always call him a moron! MIKE He called for a bomb on fourth and one! Look, I don't know what's going on with you lately. Do we need to take you to feed the homeless or build a church or something. Cause believe me, mister, we'll do it! AXL Whatever. And Axl storms to his room, SLAMS his door. MIKE Yeah, you go to your room! You're gonna want to rest up for all the chores you got ahead of you! You can start by fixing the dryer! (under his breath) Moron. FRANKIE Dammit. If only he had a cell phone, or TV or car... something good we could take away. BRICK Mom, you're my superhero. FRANKIE (preoccupied) That's sweet, honey, but we're busy thinking up a good punishment for your brother. BRICK You'll need a costume. (then whispering) Costume. FRANKIE Huh? BRICK I'm doing a book report on Superwoman. You have to come dressed like her Monday so I can show and tell you as part of my project. You could also come as Jungle Girl, but I'd have to know today. FRANKIE Dammit, Brick, you have to tell me these things earlier! THE MIDDLE "Pilot" Table Draft (white) 1/28/09 19. BRICK I did! I've been telling you all week you're my superhero! Didn't you listen?! Brick bursts into tears, runs into his room and slams his door. FRANKIE Brick, I didn't mean it! Don't cry -- Brick! MIKE Let him be. She plops down next to Mike. They both feel like crap. FRANKIE You know what? I always thought I was a pretty good mom. But lately... I don't know. MIKE Hey, hey, you're a great mom. Sure, Brick's weird, Sue has no recognizable talent and Axl is flushing his future down the toilet. But all kids are screwed up. FRANKIE Not the Donahues across the street. MIKE No, those kids are awesome. They ponder this a moment. Just then, Sue bursts in the front door, full of excitement. SUE I did it! I made Show Choir! Mike and Frankie stare, shocked and skeptical. FRANKIE You did? MIKE You sure, honey? Is it actually written down somewhere? SUE Yes! And they already rotated me in and I've got to learn everything super quick for our first competition next Friday. THE MIDDLE "Pilot" Table Draft (white) 1/28/09 20. FRANKIE (hugging her) Well, God, Sue... this is huge! MIKE C'mere girl. I am proud of you. SUE Thanks, Dad. I better get my homework done 'cause I am going to be so busy! Sue floats to her room. Mike and Frankie look at each other in amazed disbelief. He picks her up, twirls her around in a hug. FRANKIE (V.O.) See? Prayer does work. Suck that, Donahues. DISSOLVE TO: 42 EXT. HECK BACKYARD -- SUNDAY EVENING 42 A banner reads, "Yay, Sue!" The backyard's full of friends chatting (including Bob) and eating various salads that don't contain lettuce, assorted relatives in lawn chairs nursing beers, kids shivering in the leaf-filled, freezing cold aboveground pool. AUNT EDIE and AUNT GINNY, two ancient fossils both smoking a cigarette, have Sue cornered. AUNT EDIE Sue I'm just so proud of you. I never thought you would make anything, here's a dollar. She pulls a dollar out from under her wig and hands it to her. Frankie looks up from where she was helping Mike work the barbeque. FRANKIE (calling) Come on, everybody! It's getting cold. We should all come in and eat together as a family! SMASH CUT TO: 43 INT. LIVING ROOM -- A FEW MINUTES LATER 43 Everybody is squashed in front of the TV with plates in their laps, watching Extreme Makeover, Home Edition. ALL MOVE... THAT... BUS!!! THE MIDDLE "Pilot" Table Draft (white) 1/28/09 21. 44 INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM -- A FEW NIGHTS LATER 44 SPOTLIGHT ON a MALE CHOIR DIRECTOR. CHOIR DIRECTOR (into mic) And now ladies and gentlemen... fresh from their knockout performance at Hoosier Village Assisted Living in Terra Haute -- OLD LADY FROM CROWD (O.S.) Woo. CHOIR DIRECTOR -- the Orson Swingsations! Lots of applause and cheers especially from Frankie and Mike who are looking pretty darn proud. Frankie gives a little wave to Bob, who gives a thumbs up back. Axl looks like he's being held prisoner and Brick's reading a book... ANGLE ON the ORSON SWINGSATIONS taking the stage. Overly made-up blondes with flipped hair in Lawrence Welk-ish sparkly dresses and boys in silky red shirts and jazz pants dance on while singing "Get This Party Started." ORSON SWINGSATIONS "Sending out the message to all of my friends. We'll be looking flashy in my Mercedes Benz..." Frankie scans the stage, then concerned, whispers to Mike. FRANKIE Do you see Sue? Mike scans the stage. PAN ACROSS the line of singing and dancing girls... None of them Sue. MIKE No. Where the hell is she? ANGLE ON the stage as just then, CREW MEMBERS dressed in black appear on the side of the risers to hand out props to the performers. And there in the darkness is Sue. MIKE (CONT'D) (realizing) ... She's on the crew? AXL Great. The only thing lamer than show choir is being on the crew for show choir. THE MIDDLE "Pilot" Table Draft (white) 1/28/09 22. AUNT EDIE, sitting next to Frankie, leans over. AUNT EDIE Where's Sue? FRANKIE (vaguely indicating nowhere in particular) She's... up there. AUNT EDIE I don't see her. I put out my cigarette for this? FRANKIE (same motion) In the middle-ish row. Behind the pregnant one. (turning to Mike) Why didn't she tell us she was only on the crew? MIKE I don't know. She does look really happy though. ANGLE ON Sue. She does look happy -- she's smiling while she runs out to place a wooden cube onstage. Seeing Sue so excited does something to Mike. He nudges another parent. MIKE (CONT'D) Hey. That's my daughter. That's my daughter right there! (jumping to his feet and applauding) Go Sue! Frankie stands and joins him. They're hooting and hollering, nudging Axl and Brick to join in. Everyone around them is giving them strange looks, but they don't care. This is Sue's moment, and dammit they're going to give it to her. ANGLE ON the stage, where Sue hears them and smiles proudly and waves -- it's a sweet moment. Unfortunately we see that while Sue is waving, other crew people are setting other cubes onstage, but due to the distraction, Sue is late with her cube... and the girl who was supposed to step down off a cube onto it instead FALLS FLAILING to the ground. She tries frantically to save herself by GRABBING A NEARBY GIRL... they BOTH GO DOWN, which starts a CHAIN REACTION, all the Swingsations going down in a disastrous tangle of red shirts and dresses leaving Sue the only one standing. Frankie and Mike cringe in horror. Aunt Edie pulls out a cigarette. THE MIDDLE "Pilot" Table Draft (white) 1/28/09 23. AUNT EDIE (lighting up) Screw it, we're already in trouble... FADE OUT. END OF ACT THREE THE MIDDLE "Pilot" Table Draft (white) 1/28/09 24. ACT FOUR 45 INT. HECK BEDROOM -- MORNING 45 Frankie sits up in bed and looks at her reflection in the mirror across the room. FRANKIE (V.O.) No wonder my face looks the way it does. The Swingsation disaster had gotten Sue kicked off crew. 46 CLOSE ON 46 A "PROUD PARENT OF A SWINGSATION" BUMPER STICKER being RIPPED OFF the bumper. 47 RESUME SCENE 47 FRANKIE (V.O.) So when Brick said it was the day of his book report... Suddenly, Brick's there poking her. BRICK Today's the day of my book report. FRANKIE (V.O.) ...I had nothing left to give. But then I thought about Brick, and how his best friend is a backpack. I couldn't undo the twenty-seven hours he'd spent in the birth canal, but damn it, I could do this. With new determination, Frankie throws back the covers. SUPERHERO MUSIC begins to play. FRANKIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) I put on my spanx and went. VARIOUS SHOTS OF Frankie struggling with her Spanx as the superhero music continues to play. 48 INT. SECOND GRADE CLASSROOM -- CONTINUOUS 48 Frankie, now in costume, enters with a flourish, as the kids sit on the rug listening to Mrs. Rettig. FRANKIE Did somebody call for Superwoman?! The kids and Mrs. Rettig turn and stare at her, surprised. MRS. RETTIG Oh. That's next Monday. THE MIDDLE "Pilot" Table Draft (white) 1/28/09 25. FRANKIE (to Brick) Are you freaking kidding me?! She starts to go after Brick. The teacher puts her arms around him, protectively. 49 INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER 49 Frankie trudges down the hallway, upset. Her phone rings. FRANKIE (into phone) Hey, Bob. 50 INT. EHLERT MOTORS - INTERCUT 50 Bob speaks conspiratorially into the phone. BOB Frankie, it's me, Bob. Listen, that Gail woman came back to purchase a car and she's asking for you, but that dummy Pete's starting to move in for the kill. I'm plying her with sno-cones, but I can't hold on much longer. She's already on her second grape! FRANKIE (panicked) No! That's my customer! Don't let her move! I'll be right there! She runs out the door, pulling up her tights, her cape flying behind her. 51 INT. MUSTANG -- A LITTLE LATER 51 Frankie, still in Superwoman gear, is in the passenger seat next to Gail. Desperate to sell the car, she's letting the stress get to her, and it shows. FRANKIE (losing it) -- and the braking system is just so great. Cause, it, you know, stops really well, and it's got this awesome -- you know, steering wheel -- you can turn it and honk at people if they're in your way -- GAIL (gently) Frankie. Are you okay? You seem a little... stressed. THE MIDDLE "Pilot" Table Draft (white) 1/28/09 26. FRANKIE (stressed) What? No, I'm fine. I'm perfect. Where was I? The horn! You'll love the horn, see how great it is -- (honking it maniacally) I'm a matchmaker, did I tell you that? -- for people and uh... where was I again? GAIL You know, I'm a mom too. I know what it's like to balance work and kids. I've got three. FRANKIE I've got three too. GAIL Isn't it hard? Frankie looks at her. She can't help herself, but under the exhaustion, this moment of kindness is more than she can take and she starts to cry. FRANKIE So hard! I feel like I'm spread so thin I can't do anything right. GAIL I know. Some days I swear I just feel like getting in the car and driving and driving and never coming back. You ever feel like that? FRANKIE Only every day. SMASH CUT TO: 52 EXT. TOWN -- DAY 52 FRANKIE Woo-hoo! The convertible top now down, Frankie and Gail tear down the two-lane highway. Thelma and Louise on the open road! 53 INT. MUSTANG -- CONTINUOUS 53 Gail laughs. Frankie feels amazing. She stands up to feel the wind in her hair, her cape billowing behind her. FRANKIE Yeah, baby! BUMP! THE MIDDLE "Pilot" Table Draft (white) 1/28/09 27. GAIL What was that? FRANKIE What was what? GAIL (stopping) I think we hit something. Is there something wrong with this car? Maybe you better check. FRANKIE (climbing out) I'm sure it's fine. She gets on her knees on the road and crouches down to peer under the car. FRANKIE (CONT'D) I don't see anything -- But before she can finish, the car SCREECHES AWAY, Gail behind the wheel stealing it! FRANKIE (CONT'D) Hey! GAIL (yelling back) Sorry! I've got three kids in jail! FRANKIE Wha --? (calling) You'll never get away with this! I have your license back at the office! (then realizing) I bet that's not even her real license. The picture was too good. Frankie stands in the middle of the cornfields with nothing but her Superwoman costume, stunned. DISSOLVE TO: 54 EXT. COUNTRY ROAD -- BACK TO WHERE WE STARTED 54 Frankie trudges down the road in her costume, exhausted, as the sun is setting. She looks up to see a gleaming, white TRUCK coming her way. FRANKIE (V.O.) And then I saw it... a Little Betty truck coming to rescue me. (MORE) THE MIDDLE "Pilot" Table Draft (white) 1/28/09 28. FRANKIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) At first I didn't think it was real -- I mean, I have hallucinated trucks full of chocolate snackcakes before... FRANKIE (waving arms) Yes! Yes! The truck passes her by in a WHOOSH! FRANKIE (CONT'D) Aww, come on! Then she notices a lone snack cake has fallen off the truck. Starving, she dashes into the road, rips the package open with her teeth and starts devouring it. Just when she's sunk about as low as she can go, Frankie turns to see their little old family car with Mike at the wheel. MIKE Somebody call for a ride? Frankie looks up and sees not just Mike, but the whole family -- Axl, Sue, and Brick -- are inside. FRANKIE (V.O.) That's the thing about family. Sure they eat your food and wreck your face and you gotta save 'em a thousand times a day from God knows what... but every now and then, they save you. Frankie goes to get in, but Mike speeds up. As she goes to grab the door handle again, he keeps going a little faster and faster. Very funny. MIKE Not very fast for a Superhero. Frankie shoots him a look, then finally gets in. 55 INT. CAR -- CONTINUOUS 55 Frankie settles in. MIKE Seems like you had a rough day, so we made you dinner. Axl tosses a fast food sack into her lap. Frankie laughs and opens it, peers inside. THE MIDDLE "Pilot" Table Draft (white) 1/28/09 29. FRANKIE Awww, you make it just like I do. (looking at her family) I love you guys, you know. SUE We know, Mom. They ride quietly a beat. FRANKIE (to Mike) Hey. How come you never tell me you love me? MIKE I told you I loved you the day I married you. If anything had changed, I'd have let you know. He drapes his arm over the back of her seat. Frankie nestles in... home. 56 EXT. CORNFIELD - CONTINUOUS 56 The car continues down the road, the wide expanse of green looking beautiful in the sunset. FRANKIE (V.O.) So yeah, back then on the old license I didn't know what my life was gonna be. And Mike's right... now I know. This is my life. It's not gonna be in People magazine or anything, but, you know what? I got it good. As the car gets smaller and smaller in the distance, we HEAR their overlapping voices laughing and talking as they eat their dinner... BRICK (O.S.) Mo-om! He's hogging the french fries. (whispering to himself) French fries. MIKE (O.S.) I said knock it off... PAN UP to reveal an airplane passing by overhead, on its way to somewhere else. And we...
