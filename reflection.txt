The source bodies of texts we chose were the scripts of the pilot episodes of two different sitcoms: How I Met Your Mother (HIMYM) and Modern Family. The new texts of bodies chosen to compare against the sources were also scripts of the pilot episode of the following sitcoms: FRIENDS, The Big Bang Theory, The Goldbergs and The Middle. The results of our comparisons were that for the sitcoms about a group of friends (FRIENDS and The Big Bang Theory), our program classifies them as more likely to have come from HIMYM. On the other hand, the sitcoms about families (The Goldbergs and The Middle), are more likely to have come from the source body of Modern Family, according to the program.

This proves that our text classification program works accordingly and well, because it is able to make proper comparisons between the pilot scripts of sitcoms about groups of friends and sitcoms about families. It could be improved if there were more than seven examples for the stem function, and if there were more than four ways to compare the models between the texts so that the final result would be even more precise.
