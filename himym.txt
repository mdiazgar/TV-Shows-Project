*
NARRATOR (O.S.) *
*
Okay. You guys are old enough. I’m *

your mother. *
DAUGHTER *
*
Heard it. *
*
SON *
You told us already. *
*
NARRATOR (O.S.) *
Sure, you’ve heard the short version.
But there’s a bigger story, and it’s *
important for you to hear it. *
*
SON *

Are we being punished for something? *
*
NARRATOR (O.S.) *
*
No. *
DAUGHTER *
*
Is this gonna take awhile? *
*

Yes. Once upon a time, before I was *

TED HANGING OUT AT A BAR, TED ON A CONSTRUCTION SITE HOLDING *
BLUEPRINTS, TED IN CENTRAL PARK, TED IN HIS APARTMENT WITH *
MARSHALL, HIS BOYISH, MIDWESTERN BEST FRIEND. *
NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT’D) *
It was way back in 2005. I was single, *
I had a full head of hair, my career *
as an architect was taking off, and I *
lived in New York City with Marshall, *
my best friend from college. Life was *
good, until one brisk October night, *
when Uncle Marshall screwed the whole *
thing up. *
INT. TED AND MARSHALL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT *
(MARSHALL, TED, NARRATOR) *
A 20-SOMETHING BACHELOR APARTMENT THAT, TONIGHT, HAS BEEN *
SPRUCED UP A BIT. MARSHALL, ON BENDED KNEE, NERVOUSLY *
PRESENTS TED WITH A DIAMOND RING. *
MARSHALL *
Will you marry me? *
TED *
Perfect! And then she says yes, you’re *
engaged, you pop the champagne, drink *
a toast, have sex on the kitchen *
floor. (BEAT, THINKS) Don’t have sex *
on our kitchen floor. *
MARSHALL *
Got it. Geez, I’m so nervous. My *
stomach’s going crazy. *

TED *
It’s not cancer. *
MARSHALL *
Who said cancer? *
TED *
You were about to. *
MARSHALL *
It could be cancer! I’ve got all these *
symptoms, I’ve been peeing like crazy, *
my mouth is dry, she’s gonna say no! *
TED *
All right, c’mere, bring it in. *
TED GIVES HIM A HUG. *
MARSHALL *
Thanks for helping me plan this out, *
Ted. *
TED *
Dude, it’s you and Lily! I’ve been *
there for all the big moments of you *
and Lily. The night you met, your *
first date...other first things. *
MARSHALL *
I’m sorry. We thought you were asleep. *
TED *
It’s physics, Marshall. If the bottom *
bunk moves, the top bunk moves too. *
4.
TED(CONT'D)
But that was nine years ago, the *
nightmares have almost stopped. (BEAT) *
And you’re getting engaged. Tonight. *
MARSHALL *
Yeah. What are you doing tonight? *
TED THINKS. FREEZE FRAME. *
NARRATOR *
What was I doing? Here Uncle Marshall *
was taking the biggest step of his *
life, and me? I’m calling up this guy. *

SPLIT-SCREEN BETWEEN TED AND BARNEY (32, DEVILISH, LIVES ON *
STEAKS AND CIGARS). BARNEY’S CELL PHONE RINGS. HE SEES WHO IT *
IS, AND ANSWERS. *
BARNEY *
Hey, so you know how I’ve always had a *
thing for half-Asian girls? *
FREEZE FRAME ON BARNEY. *
NARRATOR (V.O.) *
Your Uncle Barney. *
UNFREEZE. *
BARNEY *
Well, I have a new favorite: Lebanese *
girls. Lebanese girls are the new half- *
Asians. *

5.
TED *
I don’t even know what a Lebanese girl *
looks like. *
BARNEY *
Trust me. They’re Leba-licious. *
TED *
Listen, Marshall’s getting engaged *
here tonight. You wanna-- *
BARNEY *
(SNAPPING INTO ACTION) Meet me at the *
bar in fifteen. And suit up! *
TED *
No, no “suit up.” *
BARNEY *
Suit up or I’m not coming. *
TED *
(BEAT) Fine, I’ll suit up. *
INT. BAR - NIGHT *
(BARNEY, TED, YASMIN, NARRATOR) *
A NON-TRENDY CLASSIC NEW YORK NEIGHBORHOOD BAR, CURRENTLY *
POPULATED BY A SMALL WEDNESDAY-AFTER-WORK CROWD. TED APPEARS *
IN A LONG SLEEVE T-SHIRT AND CASUAL SLACKS. BARNEY GLARES. *
BARNEY *
Where’s your suit? We said suit up! I *
show up looking awesome and you show *
up in your pajamas? Fine. I’m *
Superman, you’re Clark Kent. *

6.
TED *
Wait, doesn’t Clark Kent always wear a *
suit? And doesn’t Superman kinda wear *
pajamas? *
BARNEY *
(IN A FEMALE VOICE) “Ooh, Michelle,
check out those two guys over at the
bar arguing about Superman. God, that
gets me hot!” (AS HIMSELF) Come on,
Ted. Pull yourself together.
TED *
You know what’s weird? I just spent *
all day planning this romantic *
marriage proposal...and it’s for *
someone else. *
BARNEY *
Oh, I see. Marshall gets engaged, and *
all of a sudden your ovaries are *
shrinking. Have you forgotten what I *
said to you the night we met? We were *
sitting right over there... *
WE STYLISHLY WHIP-PAN TO A BOOTH WHERE, MAGICALLY, A YOUNGER *
BARNEY SITS NEXT TO A YOUNGER TED, WHO HAS A GOATEE. BARNEY *
PUTS HIS ARM AROUND TED. *
TITLE: FOUR YEARS EARLIER... *
7.
BARNEY (CONT’D) *
Ted, I’m gonna teach you how to live. *
(OFF TED’S CONFUSION) Barney. We met *
at the urinal. *
TED *
Oh, right. Hi. *
BARNEY *
Lesson one, lose the goatee. Lesson *
two, never wear jeans to a strip club. *
You want a fabric that’s light and *
roomy. *
TED *
Why? (BEAT, REALIZING) Oh. *
BARNEY *
Lesson three: don’t even think about *
getting married till you’re 30. *
WHIP-PAN BACK TO PRESENT-DAY BARNEY AND TED AT THE BAR. *
TED *
I’m not thinking about it. Just ‘cuz *
my best friend’s getting married *
doesn’t mean I have to. *
BARNEY *
I thought I’m your best friend. (BEAT) *
Ted, say I’m your best friend. *
TED *
You’re my best friend, Barney. *

8.
BARNEY *
Good. Then as your best friend, I *
suggest we play a little game I call, *
“Have Ya Met Ted?” *
TED *
What? No, we’re not playing “Have Ya *
Met Ted.” *
TOO LATE. BARNEY TAPS AN EXOTIC, SEXY GIRL ON THE SHOULDER. *
BARNEY *
Hi. Have ya met Ted? *
BARNEY WALKS AWAY, LEAVING TED ALONE WITH THE GIRL. AWKWARD *
BEAT. TED SMILES, STICKS OUT HIS HAND. *

INT. TED AND MARSHALL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
(MARSHALL, LILY)
THE TABLE’S SET, AND COOKING IS UNDERWAY. MARSHALL’S TRYING *
TO LIGHT MANY CANDLES WITH ONE DWINDLING MATCH. *
9.
MARSHALL
Ow! Ow ow ow ow ow ow! *
THE FRONT DOOR OPENS. LILY (EARTHY, STRONG, MATERNAL) ENTERS.
LILY
I’ve had a long day, my eyes could be *
playing tricks on me - but it almost *
looks like you’re cooking. *
MARSHALL *
I am. You’ve been taking care of hyper- *
active kindergartners all day. So now *
I’m taking care of you. *
LILY *
Oh, you’re the best. It was finger- *
painting day. *
SHE OPENS HER COAT TO REVEAL A NICE BLOUSE COVERED IN FINGER- *
PAINT. THERE IS A CLEAR HANDPRINT ON HER BREAST. *
MARSHALL *
Did someone touch your boob? *
LILY *
Justin Stangel. He’s a very advanced *
little boy. (THEN) I could really use *
a shower. *
MARSHALL
You go ahead. I’ll propose the feast *
(CATCHING HIMSELF) prepare the feast. *
LILY HEADS FOR THE BATHROOM. MARSHALL LOOKS AT A RECIPE.
10.
MARSHALL (CONT’D)
Hey, sweetie? If the recipe says
cinnamon and we don’t have cinnamon,
can I use nutmeg?
LILY
Sure, I guess.
MARSHALL
Sweetie, where’s the nutmeg?
LILY
On the spice-rack. *
LILY ALMOST MAKES IT TO THE BATHROOM THIS TIME, BUT THEN...
MARSHALL
Where’s the spice-rack? *
LILY
Over the oven!
MARSHALL
Oh, here it is. Oh, hey, we do have
cinnamon! (BEAT) Wait, it’s cinnamon
sticks. Can you eat these? (WITH A *
MOUTHFUL) Oh, no, no you cannot. *
Sweetie?!
LILY PUTS HER HEAD IN HER HANDS.
INT. BAR - NIGHT
(TED, YASMIN) *
TED SITS AT A TABLE, FLIRTING WITH YASMIN. *

11.
TED
Here’s how it breaks down: I’m 27 now. *
I’ll make partner at my architecture *
firm by 30, so that’s when I’ll start *
looking. It’ll take two years to meet
her, that’s 32. We date for a year, *
and at 33, I propose. Then you need a
year to book a room and a decent band. *
That puts me married at 34. So, yeah, *
marriage is the furthest thing from my *
mind right now. *
YASMIN *
Really? Because it’s all you’ve talked *
about for the past ten minutes. *
TED *
That’s not true. I also mentioned I’m *
a successful architect. You caught *
that, right? *
YASMIN *
(LAUGHS) Yes. But I don’t think you *
can design your life like it’s some *
building. What if you meet a girl who *
wants to start a family right away? *
You haven’t planned when you’re going *
to have kids, have you? *

12.
TED *
One when I’m 36, one when I’m 39. Two *
boys. *
INT. 2029 LIVING ROOM - EVENING *
(DAUGHTER, NARRATOR) *
DAUGHTER *
Hey! *
NARRATOR (O.S.) *
Oh, honey, I’m very glad we had you. *
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
(MARSHALL, LILY)
LILY, FRUSTRATED, COOKS FRANTICALLY OVER THE STOVE, WHILE
MARSHALL HOVERS NEARBY, NOT COOKING. *
MARSHALL
This is great. Cooking together, as a
couple.
LILY SHOOTS HIM A LOOK.
MARSHALL (CONT’D)
Ooh! Almost forgot!
HE OPENS THE FRIDGE, GRABS A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE.
LILY *
Oh, honey, champagne! *
A BEAT. MARSHALL HOLDS OUT THE BOTTLE, EXPECTANTLY. *
LILY (CONT’D) *
No. Uh-uh. I’m standing here, cooking
your romantic dinner for me, no,
you’re opening that bottle yourself.
A BEAT. HE GIVES HER THE PUPPY DOG EYES.
13.
LILY (CONT’D)
Marshall, you’re too old to be scared
to open a champagne bottle.
MARSHALL
I’m not scared.
LILY
Then open it!
MARSHALL
Fine. (A BEAT) Please open it. *
LILY
Dammit, Marshall!
THEY CONTINUE ARGUING.
INT. BAR - NIGHT
(NARRATOR, MARSHALL, TED)
WE GO TO A SPLIT SCREEN. AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN, MARSHALL
AND LILY CONTINUE ARGUING. AT THE BOTTOM, TED KEEPS ON
FLIRTING WITH YASMIN.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
In life, there are two big, gutsy *
questions a man has to ask. One’s
usually sweet and romantic, and the *
other usually comes half-drunk in some
bar. But they’re equally important. *
MARSHALL WHIPS OUT THE RING.
MARSHALL
Will you marry me?
14.
TED
You wanna go out sometime? *
CUT TO:
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
(LILY)
LILY SCREAMS.
LILY
Yes!!!
SHE JUMPS ON MARSHALL. THEY FALL TO THE FLOOR.
CUT TO:
INT. BAR - NIGHT
(YASMIN) *
YASMIN LOOKS AT TED, AND SMILES.
YASMIN
Sorry. The bartender’s my boyfriend. *
A MUSCULAR BARTENDER GLARES AT TED FROM DOWN THE BAR. *
CUT TO:
INT. KITCHEN - A BIT LATER
(MARSHALL, LILY)
THE ROOM LOOKS EMPTY. THEN MARSHALL SITS UP INTO FRAME,
SHIRTLESS, HAIR MUSSED UP, GRINNING LIKE AN IDIOT. *
MARSHALL
I promised Ted we wouldn’t do that. *
LILY SITS UP AS WELL, GRINNING.
LILY
Champagne?
MARSHALL *
Allow me, Mademoiselle. *
HE GETS UP, AND PICKS UP THE BOTTLE.
15.
(MORE)
MARSHALL (CONT’D) *
I don’t know why I was so scared of
this. It’s really pretty easy, right?
LILY STARTS TO GET UP, AS MARSHALL FIDDLES WITH THE BOTTLE.
HE ABSENTMINDEDLY AIMS IT AT LILY. POP!
LILY (O.S.)
OWWW!!!
INT. BAR - NIGHT
(BARNEY, TED, NARRATOR)
TED AND BARNEY SIT AT THE BAR DRINKING.
BARNEY
What are you thinking, hitting on the *
bartender’s girlfriend?! *
TED
I bet Marshall and Lily’ll start *
having kids soon. *
BARNEY *
Oh God, we’re back on this... *
TED *
I always figured our kids would play *
together. But now Marshall’s pulling *
ahead. My kids’ll be playing Candyland *
while Marshall junior’s out on the *
porch sneaking cigarettes. *
BARNEY
Okay, lesson number -- God, what are *
we up to? 749 or 750. We’ll round up. *
16.
BARNEY(CONT'D)
Lesson 750: Shut up! You’re too young *
to get married! *
TED *
Six days older than Marshall. *
BARNEY *
Marshall’s from Minnesota. 27-yearolds in Minnesota have grandkids. In
New York, there’s a bar on every
corner. In New York, you’re too young.
TED
You’re right. And there’s one other *
big difference between me and *
Marshall: he’s found the love of his *
life. Even if I was ready, it’s like, *
okay, I’m ready! Where is she? *
HE PRETENDS TO LOOK AROUND...BUT THEN ACTUALLY SEES SOMETHING *
THAT STOPS HIM COLD. *
NARRATOR (V.O.)
And there she was.
WE SEE WHO HE’S LOOKING AT: STANDING BETWEEN TWO OF HER
FRIENDS, ROBIN SCHERBATSKY LOOKS BACK AT TED.
